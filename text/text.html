    <!-- <strong> LOL </strong> this will bold the word 'LOL' in the
      sentence.
      <u> Hello </u> this will underline the word 'Hello' in the 
      sentence
      <i> Hello </i> this will italisize the word 'Hello' in the 
      sentence
      <span> Yolo </span> the span element is most generic and has 
      no styles. but we can always create a class in there
      [<span class = "text_yolo">] (you can create class in other ones
      too but its usually not that useful). This way we can style the
      word Yolo however we want without affecting anything else in a
      paragraph.
      Since you can't use text-align on a button to align it in the 
      center you need to use paragraph and make a class inside of that
      which you can do text-align on, you have to use span and make a
      class inside span (Text-align doesn't work in span class). That
      you will later edit and choose a background-color for which will
      then act like a button and you can edit it from there on.
